(or Emin aug 5
if it exists)

if you play a minor on top of a major, you get a seventh?
cadences play some chords in an order, like punct in a sentence
playful cadence 4 -> 1

vertical vs                     horizontal harmony
sounds good together            sounds good after

markov chain
state machines for cadence
ideas like coop racing games

then mod by 12
