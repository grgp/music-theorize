This React webapp displays the chord you're playing on your midi keyboard. Still a work in progress.

## Credits
This project was bootstrapped from @scott-ammon's [web-midi-keyboard](https://github.com/scott-ammon/web-midi-keyboard#readme), it also uses his [web-midi-hooks](https://github.com/scott-ammon/web-midi-hooks) library. I didn't find the license for the web-midi-keyboard repo, so I hope this is okay.

## Quickstart
```
yarn
yarn start
(you can also use npm)
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.
